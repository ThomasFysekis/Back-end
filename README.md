# Virtual Learning Environment

This is a small project from my university that consists of a website where tutors and students can interact.

## Features


- Tutors can upload homework, documents and other materials required for a virtual learning environment.

- There are no sign-ups required; tutors can add, delete, and edit users.

- Login credentials for tutors: 
    - Email: thwmas321@gmail.com
    - Password: 321321
- Login credentials for students:
    - Email: mixalis@gmail.com
    - Password: 12345

Please note that the focus of this project was on the back-end functionality implemented using PHP, rather than the front-end design, which was developed hastily in a day and may not be optimized for user experience.
